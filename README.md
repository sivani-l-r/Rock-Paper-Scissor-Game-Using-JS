# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game-Using-JS
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played between the user and the computer, and the goal is to select the winning choice out of the three options. The game keeps track of the score and displays it at the bottom of the page.
